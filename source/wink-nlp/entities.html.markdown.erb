# entities()
<code class="signature">entities() â†’ { collection of entities }</code>

This API returns a collection of entities. You can extract entities from a wink-nlp document or you can call this API on a sentence item and extract a collection of entities from that sentence.

The raw text may have entities like date, ordinal, cardinal, money, percent, time, duration, hashtag, emoji, emoticon, email, url and mention. If the input text does not contain any entities, then an empty collection is returned. If the input text contains only a single entity, like a date or number, then a collection with single member is returned.

You can chain it further with other wink-nlp APIs like `each()`, `length()`, `filter()`, etc. However, to get the output in a JavaScript data type, you need to follow this API with `out()`.

__Example:__
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>// Boilerplate code goes here
const text = `At 4:18 p.m. on July 20, 1969, a voice crackled from the speakers
  at NASA\'s Mission Control in Houston. He said simply, "the Eagle has landed."
  They spent nearly 21 hours on the lunar surface. Twenty percent of the
  world\'s population watched humans walk on the Moon for the first time. The
  space-mission was televised live in 33 countries. To know more, visit

const doc = nlp.readDoc( text );

// Entities in wink-nlp doc
const entities = doc.entities().out();
console.log( entities );
// -> [ '4:18 p.m.',
//      'July 20, 1969',
//      'nearly 21 hours',
//      'Twenty percent',
//      'first',
//      '33',
//      'https://tinyurl.com/y85owr2u' ]

// Entities in a sentence item
const sentence = doc.sentences().itemAt( 3 );//-> Twenty percent of...first time.
console.log( 'Entities in Sentence No.: 4' );
console.log( sentence.entities().out() );
// -> Entities in Sentence No.: 4
//    [ 'Twenty percent', 'first' ]</code></pre>
