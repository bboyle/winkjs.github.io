# sentences()

<code class="signature">sentences() â†’ { collection of sentences }</code>

This API returns a collection of sentences in the winkNLP document. If the input text contains one sentence, then we get a collection of sentences with a single member. Likewise, if no sentence-break is found in the input text, we get the output in the same manner!

You can chain it further with other winkNLP APIs like `each()`, `length()`, `filter()`, etc. However, to get the output in a JavaScript data type, you need to follow this API with `out()`.

__Example:__

<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>// Boilerplate code goes here>
const text = `AI Inc. is focussing on AI. I work for AI Inc. My mail is r2d2@yahoo.com! The U.S.A is my birth place. I was born on 06.12.1996. I climbed Mt. Everest.`;
const doc = nlp.readDoc( text );
const sentences = doc.sentences().out();
console.log( sentences );
// -> [ 'AI Inc. is focussing on AI.',
//      'I work for AI Inc.',
//      'My mail is\nr2d2@yahoo.com!',
//      'The U.S.A is my birth place.',
//      'I was born on 06.12.1996.',
//      'I climbed\nMt. Everest.' ]

// Tweet
const text = '3rd TIME watching That70sShow:D @Netflix http://tiny.cc/fijqkz';
const doc = nlp.readDoc( text );
console.log( doc.sentences().out() );
// -> ['3rd TIME watching That70sShow:D @Netflix http://tiny.cc/fijqkz']

// Single sentence
const text = 'Mr. Z owns AI Inc. and he climbed Mt. Everest.';
const doc = nlp.readDoc( text );
console.log( doc.sentences().out() );
// -> [ 'Mr. Z owns AI Inc. and he climbed Mt. Everest.' ]</code></pre>
