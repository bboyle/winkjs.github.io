# parentCustomEntity()
<code class="signature">parentCustomEntity() -> { wink-nlp custom entity }</code>

This method returns the parent custom entity (if any) of a `token` item, as only a `token` may have a parent custom entity. If there is no parent custom entity, it returns `undefined`.

The custom entity is returned in a winkNLP format and can either be chained with other winkNLP methods or it can be followed by `out()` to get the entity as a string.


<div class="docs-tip docs-tip--green">
  winkNLP has a lossless tokenizer â€” notice how it has preserved and reproduced all the spaces between " , " and "1972" in the following example.
</div>

__Example:__
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>// Boilerplate code and input text goes here
const text = `The Godfather premiered on March 15, 1972. It was released on March    24, 1972.`;
const patterns = [
  { name: 'event', patterns: [ '[VERB] [|ADP] [DATE|DURATION]' ] }
];
nlp.learnCustomEntities( patterns );
const doc = nlp.readDoc( text );

const token = doc.tokens().itemAt( 11 ); // -> released
const parentCustomEntity = token.parentCustomEntity();
console.log( `Token: ${ token.out() }, Parent custom entity: "${ parentCustomEntity.out() }"` );
// -> Token: released, Parent custom entity: "released on March    24, 1972"</code></pre>
