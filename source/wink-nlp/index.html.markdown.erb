Wink NLP is an advanced NLP package with zero dependecies outside winkjs. It supports a variety of NLP tasks such as tokenization, sentence boundary detection, negation handling, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction and more with ease.

Wink NLP extends developer friendly API along with a balance of performance and accuracy to the entire spectrum of users. In addition, we are working towards building a number of pre-trained models for different languages and domains.

It packs a rich feature set into a small foot print codebase of under 100 kilobytes and model sizes starting under 1 megabyte:

1. Lossless tokenizer
2. Built-in API to aid text visualization
3. Pre-trained models with word vectors
4. Easy information exrtaction from raw text
5. Extensive text pre-processing features
6. Simple token to Unique Id mapping
