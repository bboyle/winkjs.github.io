# readDoc()

<code class="signature">readDoc(text) --> { wink-nlp doc }</code>

This is the core API in wink-nlp that transforms the input text string into a wink-nlp doc, which is made of tokens along with sentences and entities. It is the centerpiece of your code.

`readDoc()` accepts any text or variable in a JavaScript string format as its parameter.

There are many ways to read the input text:
- Reading a text file from local disk or drive
- Store text in a separate variable and use the variable as a parameter to `readDoc()`
- Directly add text as a parameter to `readDoc()` API

The input text could be a word, a phrase, a sentence or more than one sentence.

Note: Include the following Boilerplate code in all examples!

<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>// Load "wink-nlp" package.
const winkNLP = require('wink-nlp');
// Load english language model â€” light version.
const model = require('wink-eng-lite-model');
// Load properties of ".out()" API
const its = require('wink-nlp/src/its.js');
const its = require('wink-nlp/src/as.js');
// Instantiate wink-nlp.
const nlp = winkNLP(model);
</code></pre>

__Example:__
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>// Boilerplate code goes here
// Read text from variable
const text = `I work for AI Inc.`;
const doc = nlp.readDoc(text);

// Read text as string
const doc = nlp.readDoc(`I work for AI Inc.`);

// Read text from file
const fs = require('fs');
text = fs.readFileSync('../sampleText.txt', 'utf8');
const doc = nlp.readDoc(text);</code></pre>
