# readDoc()

<code class="signature">readDoc(text) → { winkNLP doc }</code>

This is the core API in winkNLP that transforms the input text string into a winkNLP doc, which is made of tokens along with sentences and entities. It is the centerpiece of your code.

`readDoc()` accepts any text or variable in a JavaScript string format as its parameter.

There are many ways to read the input text:

- Reading a text file from local disk or drive
- Store text in a separate variable and use the variable as a parameter to `readDoc()`
- Directly add text as a parameter to `readDoc()` API

The input text could be a word, a phrase, a sentence or more than one sentence.

Note: Include the following Boilerplate code in all examples.

__Boilerplate code:__
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>// Load "wink-nlp" package.
const winkNLP = require('wink-nlp');
// Load english language model — light version.
const model = require('wink-eng-lite-model');
// Load properties of ".out()" API
const its = require('wink-nlp/src/its.js');
const as = require('wink-nlp/src/as.js');
// Instantiate winkNLP.
const nlp = winkNLP(model);
</code></pre>

__Example:__
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>// Read text from variable
const text = 'I work for AI Inc.';
const doc = nlp.readDoc(text);

// Read text as string
const doc = nlp.readDoc('I work for AI Inc.');

// Read text from file
const fs = require('fs');
text = fs.readFileSync('../sampleText.txt', 'utf8');
const doc = nlp.readDoc(text);</code></pre>
